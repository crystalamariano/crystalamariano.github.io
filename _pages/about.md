Hello! I am a current mechanical engineering PhD student at the University of California, Riverside (UCR). 
I primarily study the mechanics of the lung both at an organ and tissue level in the [bioMechanics 
Experimental and Computational Health (bMECH) Lab](https://bmech.engr.ucr.edu) 

I earned my bachelor's degree in Bioengineering from UCR. My undergraduate research experiences focused on materials science, 
mechanical engineering, and bioengineering, exploring transparent cranial implants centered on the synthesis, characterization,
and biocompatibility of nanoparticles. I also have experience in photolithography to aid in the etching and study of titanium microneedles.
My research interests have always been centered on *medical devices* and I currently am studying the primary chracteristics 
of lung tissue that have previously been understudied which would ultimately align with my goal of exploring pathways to 
creating medical devices to assist with easing consequences of damaged tissue caused by pulmonary illnesses.

 data scientist applying machine learning tools and causal
inference techniques to remote sensing data. I am also an affiliated
researcher with the [Data-driven Analysis of Peace Project](https://dapp-lab.org)
and a research collaborator with the 
[Research on International Policy Implementation Lab](https://bridgingthegapproject.org/ripil).

I earned my Ph.D in Political Science from the
[University *of* North Carolina *at* Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu) and my
B.A. in Political Science from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu).
My academic work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in
*International Studies Quarterly*, *Conflict Management and Peace Science*,
*Political Science Research and Methods*, and *PS: Political Science & Politics*,
among other outlets. This [research](research) explores the causes and
consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as
latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While primarily
focused on civil conflict, it also examines contentious political phenomena
including terrorism and economic statecraft, and develops new measures of
institutions in international relations. I have [teaching](teaching) experience
in both quantitative methodology and international relations, and am a certified
instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org).
