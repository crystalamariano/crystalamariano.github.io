Hello! I am a current mechanical engineering PhD student at the University of California, Riverside (UCR). 
I primarily study the mechanics of the lung both at an organ and tissue level in the [bioMechanics 
Experimental and Computational Health (bMECH) Lab](https://bmech.engr.ucr.edu). 

I earned my B.S. in Bioengineering from UCR. My undergraduate research experiences was a culmination of materials science, 
mechanical engineering, and bioengineering, exploring transparent cranial implants centered on the synthesis, characterization,
and biocompatibility of nanoparticles, also known as the 
[Window to the Brain (WttB)](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/international-window-brain-research-team-gathers-uc-riverside). 
My research interests have always been centered on *medical devices*. I am currently studying the primary chracteristics 
of lung tissue that have previously been understudied which would ultimately align with my goal of exploring pathways to 
creating medical devices to assist with easing consequences of damaged tissue caused by pulmonary illnesses.


I am also an [NSF GRFP fellow] (https://insideucr.ucr.edu/awards/2022/05/24/four-ucr-students-win-national-science-foundation-fellowships)
