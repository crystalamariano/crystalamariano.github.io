Hello! I am a current mechanical engineering PhD student at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) and an 
[NSF Graduate Research Fellowships Program](https://insideucr.ucr.edu/awards/2022/05/24/four-ucr-students-win-national-science-foundation-fellowships) fellow. 
I primarily study the mechanics of the lung both at an organ and tissue level in the [bioMechanics 
Experimental and Computational Health (bMECH) Lab](https://bmech.engr.ucr.edu). 

I earned my B.S. in Bioengineering from UCR. My undergraduate research experiences were a culmination of materials science, 
mechanical engineering, and bioengineering, exploring transparent cranial implants centered on the synthesis, characterization,
and biocompatibility of nanoparticles, also known as the 
[Window to the Brain (WttB)](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/international-window-brain-research-team-gathers-uc-riverside) project. 
My research interests have always been centered on *medical devices* which is why I am studying the primary chracteristics 
of lung tissue. Since the lung has previously been understudied prior to 
[COVID-19](https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2020/05/14/covid-19-highlights-what-we-have-yet-learn-about-lung-mechanics), my [research](research) aims to 
further explore and understand the mechanics of the lung to aid in the pathway
of creating medical devices that assist with or prevent pulmonary illnesses.
