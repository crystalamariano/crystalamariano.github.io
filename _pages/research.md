Respiratory illnesses are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Chronic pulmonary disease 
can result in irreversible lung tissue damage where mechanical ventilation is often the only means of intervention, 
as witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Modern ventilators push air into the lungs to deliver oxygen which can 
cause further damage.

My research aims to use *digital image correlation* to assess how ventilation techniques affect local pulmonary mechanics 
while simultaneously examining global lung characteristics. This includes ex-vivo lung experiments 
that will inform the development of alternative, more effective ventilation strategies.
